# REST-APIs with Flask, Postman and PostgreSQL
Develop a RESTful API system using Flask, where Postman serves as the client for
conducting CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The system efficiently
processes HTTP requests from Postman, directs them to Flask API endpoints, and
executes corresponding database queries in PostgreSQL for seamless data management.
